# Wordpress Base

**Wordpress Base** (hereforth **Wp-Base**) is a boilerplate for building Wordpress themes upon. It results of the need to have a solid, easy-to-setup starting structure upon which to build Wordpress websites.
 
As presented here, it intentionally features almost no front-end work (and when it does it targets functionality rather than form). Instead it focuses on the functionalities that need to be set in order to get a Wordpress theme going. The front-end programming is what happens hereon.
